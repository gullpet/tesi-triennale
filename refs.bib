ABSTRACT = {Nonintrusive image-based methods have the potential to advance hydrological streamflow observations by providing spatially distributed data at high temporal resolution. Due to their simplicity, correlation-based approaches have until recent been preferred to alternative image-based approaches, such as optical flow, for camera-based surface flow velocity estimate. In this work, we introduce a novel optical flow scheme, optical tracking velocimetry (OTV), that entails automated feature detection, tracking through the differential sparse Lucas-Kanade algorithm, and then a posteriori filtering to retain only realistic trajectories that pertain to the transit of actual objects in the field of view. The method requires minimal input on the flow direction and camera orientation. Tested on two image data sets collected in diverse natural conditions, the approach proved suitable for rapid and accurate surface flow velocity estimations. Five different feature detectors were compared and the features from accelerated segment test (FAST) resulted in the best balance between the number of features identified and successfully tracked as well as computational efficiency. OTV was relatively insensitive to reduced image resolution but was impacted by acquisition frequencies lower than 7&ndash;8 Hz. Compared to traditional correlation-based techniques, OTV was less affected by noise and surface seeding. In addition, the scheme is foreseen to be applicable to real-time gauge-cam implementations.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring streamflow velocity is of paramount importance for water resources management and in engineering practice. To this aim, image-based approaches have proved to be reliable systems to non-intrusively monitor water bodies in remote places at variable flow regimes. Nonetheless, to tackle their computational and energy requirements, offload processing and high-speed internet connections in the monitored environments, which are often difficult to access, is mandatory hence limiting the effective deployment of such techniques in several relevant circumstances. In this paper, we advance and simplify streamflow velocity monitoring by directly processing the image stream in situ with a low-power embedded system. By leveraging its standard parallel processing capability and exploiting functional simplifications, we achieve an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms that typically require expensive computing devices and infrastructures. The advantage of monitoring streamflow velocity in situ with a lightweight and cost-effective embedded processing device is threefold. First, it circumvents the need for wideband internet connections, which are expensive and impractical in remote environments. Second, it massively reduces the overall energy consumption, bandwidth and deployment cost. Third, when monitoring more than one river section, processing &ldquo;at the very edge&rdquo; of the system efficiency improves scalability by a large margin, compared to offload solutions based on remote or cloud processing. Therefore, enabling streamflow velocity monitoring in situ with low-cost embedded devices would foster the widespread diffusion of gauge cameras even in developing countries where appropriate infrastructure might be not available or too expensive.},
